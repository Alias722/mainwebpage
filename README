This is a simple website powered by node.js
and it is my first node.js project
I use it to run my webpage
It is simple to use
Only you need to run the following scripts

1. move to the project root folder
2. npm install
3. chmod +x runserver.sh
4. ./runserver.sh

the program will start to run in the background

How to Stop it?

run ps aux | grep node
the you will find the the program you want to stop
simply type : kill PID
then the node.js would stop soon

As for me, my node.js is running behind nginx
using proxy_pass remembered to put it inside location like this

#nginx config example
location / {
	proxy_pass 127.0.0.1:17000;
}

When you look deep inside web.js
you will figure out the website is inside static/template
just change index.html then the website is yours
